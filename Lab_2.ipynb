There are outliers on both sides with only a handful of teams either scoring extremely under the average or scoring extremely above the average. The shape of the graph, because the distribution is fairly even, represents a bell shaped curve. A bell shaped curve is when the area of the shape of the graph has approximately the same slope and meets at the same point at the average of the graph."

This represents that there still appears to be a close proximity in the amount of win pts in a season, but the change continues to grow exponentially. The years from 1997 to 2010 are all the same shape, size, and color, representing a more linear change in how many win pts were scored in a season. 1985 is the year with the least amount of win pts in a season, and therefore it is one of the smallest and lightest - in color - boxes on the graph."
